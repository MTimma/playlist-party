Hosting


Below is a pragmatic, step-by-step deployment recipe that keeps running costs low while matching the way this repo is structured today (Vite-built React SPA in /src, a tiny Express API in /server, and Firebase for auth / data). I break it into two parallel “tracks” so you can decide which cloud works best for your budget.
──────────────── A) AWS – “S3 + CloudFront + App Runner / Fargate” ────────────────
CHEAP PATH: ❄ S3 + CloudFront (static) ≈ $1–5 / month for light traffic
API PATH: 🏃 App Runner (simplest) or ECS Fargate (more knobs) ≈ $10–20 / month (scale-to-zero disabled)
Build the front-end
Apply to game_todo co...
Run
Vite
Push the SPA to S3
Create an S3 bucket (name = your domain, e.g. music-game.example.com).
Enable “Static website hosting”, set index & error to index.html.
aws s3 sync dist/ s3://music-game.example.com --delete
(Optional) add cache-control: max-age=31536000 on hashed files.
Put CloudFront in front
Origin = the S3 bucket.
Behaviours:
Default TTL 0 s (so Firestore config JSON changes propagate).
Error 404 → respond with /index.html (SPA routing).
Attach an ACM TLS cert and your domain (“music.game.com”).
Enable AWS WAF if you want basic edge-level rate-limiting.
Containerise the Express API (/server)
server/Dockerfile (example):
Apply to game_todo co...
transpile
The container listens on PORT env (App Runner will inject).
Store secrets
Spotify secrets + service-account JSON ⇒ AWS Secrets Manager.
Inject them into App Runner as plain env vars that point to SecretsManager ARNs.
Never bake them into the image.
Deploy the API (pick one):
A. App Runner (fast)
“Source: Container registry” → push image to ECR → create service.
Autoscaling: min-inst=0, max-inst=2 (scale-to-zero keeps idle cost at ~$0.007 /hr).
B. ECS Fargate (fine-grained)
Create a cluster → task def (0.25 vCPU, 0.5 GB).
Enable Application Load Balancer (ALB) HTTPS → target group.
Add auto-scale‐out at 50 % CPU, scale-in at 20 %.
Make /api/* the only exposed path; deny * in security group.
Wire CloudFront → API
Add a second origin = ALB / App Runner URL.
Behaviour: PathPattern = /api/*, forward all headers, method = ALL.
CloudFront compresses & TLS-terminates; no Nginx needed.
CI/CD (optional but cheap)
GitHub Actions → push on main → build SPA → upload to S3 → build & push API image → deploy App Runner.
Approximate cost (us-east-1, low traffic)
S3 10 GB - $0.23, requests ≪ $1
CloudFront 50 GB egress - $4.25
App Runner idle - $5–7, light load 0.1 vCPU-h/day ≈ $3
TOTAL ≈ $10–15 / month (plus Firebase reads/writes).
──────────────── B) Google Cloud – “Cloud Storage + Cloud Run” ───────────────────
CHEAP PATH: ❄ Cloud Storage static + Cloud CDN ≈ $1–4 / month
API PATH: 🏃 Cloud Run (fully managed, true scale-to-zero) ≈ $0 if idle, $9/1 vCPU-Hr
Build SPA – same as step 1 above.
Static hosting
Create bucket music-game (multi-regional).
gsutil rsync -R dist gs://music-game
gsutil web set -m index.html -e index.html gs://music-game
Enable Cloud CDN on backend bucket, add HTTPS-load-balancer front door.
Map domain via Cloud DNS, attach cert (managed cert is free).
Containerise Express API – Dockerfile identical to AWS path.
Secrets
Put Spotify & Firebase service-account JSON in Secret Manager.
Cloud Run → “Environment variables from Secret”.
Deploy Cloud Run
Apply to game_todo co...
Run
.
Concurrency 80, CPU-throttling after response.
Pricing: $0 while idle; pay per vCPU-second & egress only.
Cloud Load Balancer
Backend 1 = backend-bucket (static).
Backend 2 = Cloud Run service.
URL map: /api/* → Cloud Run.
CI/CD
Cloud Build (+ Artifact Registry) or GitHub Actions → gcloud run deploy.
Use Cloud Build free tier (120 build-min/day).
Cost example (us-central-1) – idle most of the day
Cloud Storage 10 GB - $0.20
Cloud CDN 50 GB egress - $3.50
Cloud Run CPU 0 (idle) – $0
Cold-start latency ~1–2 s (tolerable for search API).
TOTAL ≈ $4–6 / month (+ Firebase).
──────────────── C) Firebase pieces (remain unchanged) ─────────────────
Firestore + Auth free tier covers ~50 k reads + 20 k writes + 50 MB storage/month.
Past that you’re already on Blaze (pay-as-you-go); neither AWS nor GCP hosting changes those prices.
If you ever migrate off Firebase, plan to port rules & listeners to DynamoDB or Firestore-in-Datastore.
──────────────── D) Checklist Specific to THIS repo ──────────────────────
Environment vars
In both clouds expose the same vars your local .env uses:
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID, SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET, FIREBASE_CONFIG, etc.
Backend only; the SPA consumes Firebase config from build-time import.meta.env.
CORS
Express code already uses env for allowed origins. Add your CloudFront / LB domain.
Docker ignore
Add server/.dockerignore (node_modules, tests) to shrink image.
Logging & Monitoring
Enable CloudWatch Logs (AWS) or Cloud Logging (GCP).
Set alert on 4xx ratio > 5 % and Spotify 429/5xx bursts.
HTTPS only
Both stacks terminate TLS at the global edge (CloudFront / Google LB).
Set HSTS → 6 months preload in response headers.
Cost guardrails
Create AWS Budgets / GCP Budgets for monthly $25 alarm.
Cloud Run: keep min-instances=0; App Runner: same.
CloudFront: turn on “Enable Origin Shield” only if traffic spikes (>1 TB/mo).
──────────────── E) Which is cheaper? ────────────────────────────────
Light traffic & ability to accept 1–2 s cold starts → GCP Cloud Run path is ~40 % cheaper because it truly bills to zero when idle.
If you need always-warm instances (no cold starts) or you already have AWS infrastructure/credits → AWS S3 + App Runner is simpler than rolling your own ECS.
Both let you move later: Cloud Run ↔ App Runner port is literally one gcloud vs aws deploy command.
──────────────── F) Quick-start TL;DR ─────────────────────────────────
npm run build ⇒ upload dist/ to static bucket (S3 or GCS).
docker build -t music-game-api . in /server ⇒ push to registry.
Deploy container to Cloud Run (cheaper) or App Runner (AWS).
Add CDN / Load-Balancer with two origins (/ static, /api/* container).
Point DNS, set HTTPS, configure secrets, set CORS.
Turn on budget alerts; monitor logs; celebrate 🚀
All service names (App Runner, Cloud Run, CloudFront, etc.) are official; anything labelled “example” (e.g., bucket names, budget thresholds) is for illustration—double-check before applying. Let me know if you need copy-paste ready gcloud or aws commands for any step!
